# ShpAttributeManager
A python plugin for Quantum GIS (QGIS) providing tools for the management of attribute table values.

The basic logic of the tool is implemented, however there are still a couple of things to fix:

* The layout
* Marking of features to delete in the table view
* Binding of the table cell with the edit dialog
* Enabling different data types for the new field (String, int, double)
* Checking the new field name for length and blanks
* Reset the dialogue when closed
* Displaying the faeture count somewhere...
* Adding a nice progress bar for processing
