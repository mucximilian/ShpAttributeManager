# ShpAttributeManager
A python plugin for Quantum GIS (QGIS) providing tools for the management of attribute table values.

The basic logic of the tool is implemented, however there are still a couple of things to fix:

* The layout
* Marking of features to delete in the table view
* Binding of the table cell with the edit dialog
