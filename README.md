# ShpAttributeManager
A python plugin for Quantum GIS (QGIS) providing tools for the management of attribute table values QGIS plugings are stored in the .../python/plugins/ directory of your QGIS directory, depending on your OS.

The basic logic of the tool is implemented so it is already doing what it should do. However, there are still a list of things that need to be fixed/improved:

* The layout
* Marking of features to delete in the table view
* Binding of the table cell with the edit dialog
* Enabling different data types for the new field (String, int, double)
* Checking the new field name for length and blanks
* Reset the dialogue when closed
* Displaying the faeture count somewhere...
* Adding a nice progress bar for processing
